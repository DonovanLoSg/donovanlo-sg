# Defining the Project (Strategy, Scope)

The purpose of creating this website is to aid me in the process of getting a job. As a mid-life career changer, I need a resume website highlighting my knowledge and experience to help me stand out from other candidates. It will even be better if any hiring managers tumbles upon my website find me suitable for filling a position in their company.

# Strategy

## Identifying External Users

The primary purpose of this resume website is the get myself hired, therefore, the website should be 'talking' to the person who can make or influence the decision to hire me. They may be business owners, HR managers, depart heads and recruitment agencies (hereafter known as "recruiters")

## Identifying External Users' Goals

The recruiters' goal is to hire a right candidate for a position. 

As such, they will have to play detective, to decide whether the applicants are worth their time, which may last from hours to days, to be interviewed.

    EU2. to decide whether the applicant is qualified
    EU3. to find out whether the applicant has the required skills
    EU4. to see the portfolio of the applicant (if any)
    EU5. to find out how to contact the applicant
    EU6. to print out document to support their decisions when presenting to the decision makers.

They will only have a short span of time due to the overwhelming numbers of applicants starting from the time the recruitment advertisement the job vacancy. 

If an applicant is deemed suitable for a job position, they will be looking for the applicant's contact information.

## Identifying Site Owners' Goals

My goals as the site owner is to use it to get myself hired.

As a mid-career changer, switching career to software development is a tough decision. Apart from the usual negative stereotyping and discrimination against middle and old age people, there is the competition of the agile youngsters freshly graduated from the colleague equipped with the latest programming knowledge. #1

### Content Structure (CS)

The content will be regroup into a sequential structure.

Home Page > Resume Page > Portfolio Page

<img src="https://www.donovanlo.sg/readme/readme-cs.png" style="margin: 0;">
    

1. Home:
    * It starts with a home page with a hero image introducing me. Things that are not found in traditional resume.
    * It allow visitor a glimpse of my character and personality and understand me a little better.
1. Resume: 
    * The next page present the information visitor expected to see on a resume.
    * The layout should be suitable for career changer. It should be effective in showing transferrable skills and experience. It will also contain a link for the visitor to download a pdf copy of the resume. The format of the pdf copy should be similar in layout with the 'resume' page.
1.  Portfolio
    * For visitor to look for more evidence of my skills, the projects are presented in the third page.
    * It contains the names, descriptions, github hyperlinks of the current and past projects. Having a page dedicated to the projects allows the growth of the listing without affecting the layout of the other pages.


Exception - Contact

* The call for action of the site is to get the recruiter to contact me.
* So the Contact section is embedded into the footer of every page .
* It provide different means to get in touch with me as well as a contact form.
* The visitor can easily drop me a mail without needing to go out of the site to their email application to do so.


The principles of choices are taken into account. The content is organised into 3 pages.
The system applies the labelling system by using short single words (Home, Resume and Portfolio) which can easily recognised by the visitor.

Applying the principles of front doors, the users should be able to identify where they are in the site regardless of which page they landed. 
There will also be a navigation system for the visitor to jump to specific section should they decided to.

The principle of growth is considered when the projects are all group under the portfolio page. It will be easy to expand this section without affect the overall structure or other parts of the designs.
If there's a need for another sections or break one of these pages into two, it can be easily done

The layout format of the resume emphasis on transferrable skills and experience as advised by a article from Novoresume.com
https://novoresume.com/career-blog/career-change-resume

<img src="https://www.donovanlo.sg/readme/careerchangerresume.png" style="margin: 0;">

### Portfolio Page

This page used Bootstrap layout to present projects.
Each project can include a title, subtitle, a picture, a brief description and link to the actual site.

It is responsive and expandable. Inserting a new project is easy and will not need to rehash the whole page.

# Designing Graphics User Interface (Surface)

## Colour

After doing a bit of research, I decided to use blue as the theme colour.

Blue is best to show trust, honesty, reliability, intelligence, and security. These attributes make blue a perfect fit for IT resumes and when applying to non-profit organizations.

In addition to blue, I vary it's tone and added dash of magenta.

## Fonts

Sans serif fonts are used as the base for the website and the logo as they give the image of being modern, approachable, and clean.

The clean lines and sharp edges are able to render out more clearly on a screen which increases legibility for users. 

Fonts family used as the base is Open Sans (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans)
Headings fonts is PT Sans (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Sans)

For some decorative purpose PT Serif (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Serif) is used.

## Images

Hero image selected is a photograph of me (I am the 'product' of this website). It aims to let the user knows how the person behind the keyboard looks like. This also reduce the necessity of recruiters' imagining how antique i may look.

The background of the hero image is a combination of two pics, the connected dots (
https://www.pngwave.com/png-clip-art-ojanz) and the waves (https://www.pngwave.com/png-clip-art-cclln).

"Infinity of the mind is created by connecting the dots and going with the flow."

The site map navigation at the bottom gives access to individual section of the pages by one click.

# Technologies

In this project I used **HTM5** to structure the webpages and **CSS3** to style them.

I uses * **Git** * for Versioning Control System and **GitHub** for repositories.

**Gitpod**, an online IDE, is my main coding platform. I do sometimes test out codes in **Repl.it**

I use **Bootstrap 4**, including its compoents and utilities for layout.
*NavBar* is used for the main navigation, *Jumbotron* is used for displaying the hero image, *Card* is used for testimonials as well as for displaying the project and *Pagination* is used for the page navigation at the footer. *Collapse* is used to hide part of the bio.

A CSS Reset style sheet from Killer Collection of CSS Resets (https://perishablepress.com/a-killer-collection-of-global-css-reset-styles/) is used in additional to Code Institues templates (https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) to start the coding.
